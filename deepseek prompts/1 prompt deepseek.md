**Create the code for a 3d web game with first-person viewpoint were objects on a 3x3 grid come flying towards the player and he has to move left or right or up or down on this 3x3 grid to avoid being hit. So the approaching objects appear very small and then become bigger and bigger until they nearly fill the full screen.\
The objects are either a cube, a pyramid or a ball. And in the color red or green or blue. So 9 different kind of possible objects, and the next object appears when the user has successfully avoided being hit by the current object.\
After 8 objects have appeared on random positions of the 3x3 grid, a fully populated grid appears with all the 9 possible objects. This time the player has not to avoid but has to hit that object that was missing from the 8 pervious objects. This then is one level.\
For each sequence, the 8 objects have random order and no dublicates. So there is always missing one kind. And this missing kind has to be hit in the final step of that level, when the 3x3 grid offers alle 9 kinds of objects.\
If the correct missing object is hit by the player, the next level begins with a faster speed.\
For every object successfully avoided a score counter increments. Hitting the missing object at the end of each level adds 2 to the counter. So the player gains 10 points for every level.\
The player has three lives. He loses a life when being hit by an objects or if he chooses the wrong missing object at the end of a level.\
If he still has a life, the current level restarts. Otherwise it is game over and he can enter his name in a top-ten list if his socre is high enough.\
Then hitting a key restarts the game with 5 levels lower than the one he just lost. Or level 0 if he had not reached level 6 or higher.**
