# Schizobene-3d-webgame
started as a https://chat.DeepSeek.com experiment :-)

because stupid tech reviews simply prompted `write the game "snake" in python` an existing game :-( https://youtu.be/bOsvI3HYHgI?si=hdbKXkB9Yqc6ijBj&t=160

or `write the game "Tetris" in python` for which there are hundreds of tetris clones in the training data: https://youtu.be/bOsvI3HYHgI?si=BizX1apY6EnxcTOk&t=379

## So i decided to prompt DeepSeek for a new game:

first prompt [1 prompt deepseek.md](https://github.com/RoboDurden/Schizobene-3d-webgame/blob/main/deepseek%20prompts/1%20prompt%20deepseek.md)

**Create the code for a 3d web game with first-person viewpoint were objects on a 3x3 grid come flying towards the player and he has to move left or right or up or down on this 3x3 grid to avoid being hit. So the approaching objects appear very small and then become bigger and bigger until they nearly fill the full screen.\
The objects are either a cube, a pyramid or a ball. And in the color red or green or blue. So 9 different kind of possible objects, and the next object appears when the user has successfully avoided being hit by the current object.\
After 8 objects have appeared on random positions of the 3x3 grid, a fully populated grid appears with all the 9 possible objects. This time the player has not to avoid but has to hit that object that was missing from the 8 pervious objects. This then is one level.\
For each sequence, the 8 objects have random order and no dublicates. So there is always missing one kind. And this missing kind has to be hit in the final step of that level, when the 3x3 grid offers alle 9 kinds of objects.\
If the correct missing object is hit by the player, the next level begins with a faster speed.\
For every object successfully avoided a score counter increments. Hitting the missing object at the end of each level adds 2 to the counter. So the player gains 10 points for every level.\
The player has three lives. He loses a life when being hit by an objects or if he chooses the wrong missing object at the end of a level.\
If he still has a life, the current level restarts. Otherwise it is game over and he can enter his name in a top-ten list if his socre is high enough.\
Then hitting a key restarts the game with 5 levels lower than the one he just lost. Or level 0 if he had not reached level 6 or higher.**

second rewritten prompt [2 prompt deepseek.md](https://github.com/RoboDurden/Schizobene-3d-webgame/blob/main/deepseek%20prompts/2%20prompt%20deepseek.md)

**Create the code for a 3d web game with first-person viewpoint.\
For each level, the player has to fly through a tunnel where he can move sideways (x = left, right and z = up, down) with the arrow keys on a 3x3 grid. The length of the tunnel is 18 units. The player starts at y=0.\
At every  y=1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 and 15 there are 8 objects placed on the 3x3 grid so that there is only one way to fly past the obstacles. The objects should be so big that they fill 90% of their grid position. So the 8 objects act like a wall with only the empty position to fly through.\
As it is a first-person viewpoint game, when the player moves one unit to the side, all the objects are seen to shift in the opposite direction.\
And as the player flys through the tunnel, the objects get bigger in size.\
The objects are either a cube, a pyramid or a ball. And in the color red or green or blue. So 9 different kind of possible objects.\
Each wall is only made of one kind of these 9 different possible objects.\
To set the objects for these walls, make a list of the nine possible objects and shuffle them by random. Then the first 8 objects in the list set the objects for the 8 walls.\
At the end of the tunnel at y=17, there is a ninth wall. This wall is made up of all 9 possible objects placed randomly on the 3x3 grid.\
And this time, the player has to move sideways to be in that x-z position that will make him collide with the ninths object in the list. This of course is the object that no wall has yet been made of. When he collides with this special object, it disapears and the player flys through the ninth wall and completes the level, and the next level/tunnel follows with a faster speed.\
For every wall passed a score counter increments. Passing the ninth wall adds 2 to the counter. So the player gains 10 points for every level/tunnel.\
The player has three lives. He loses a life when he does not shift sideways to the only position that allows him to pass a wall. If he then still has a life, the current level restarts after a hit on the keyboard. Otherwise it is game over and he can enter his name in a top-ten list if his socre is high enough.\
After which hitting a key restarts the game with 5 levels lower than the one he just lost. Or level 0 if he had not reached level 6 or higher.**

after that i only prompted DeepSeek to make changes to the code:


**The following is the code of a first-person 3d game where the player flys down into a tunnel and has to avoid objects on a 3x3 grid. The code already has keyboard input to move the players sideways on the 3x3 grid -1,-1 to +1,+1 with 0,0 being the center.\
Now please add the code for touch event of a smartphone. Simply divide the touchsceen in the same 9 regions of an imaginary 3x3 matrix and if the use touches the upper left region, the player positions change to x,y= -1,1. If he touches the center region, it will move him to the 0,0 position.\
After the first touch, draw a permanent grid of thin lines onto the screen so the player can see the 9 reigions to touch.\
And make sure that the screen can not be zoomed in by the touch events.\
This is the code you have to change:**
[3 prompt add touch.md](https://github.com/RoboDurden/Schizobene-3d-webgame/blob/main/deepseek%20prompts/3%20prompt%20add%20touch.md)

**The following is the code of a first-person 3d game where the player flys down into a tunnel and has to avoid objects on a 3x3 grid. \
The code already has a top ten list which is saved localy on the computer.\
Please change this so that the data is sent to a php script which stores the data on a web server in a simple topScores.json text file.\
At the beginning, this online data has to be fetched so every user sees the same top ten list.\
Currently the top ten list only contains a name and the score. When prompted, also add an input field for an email address and a checkbox if the player is female.\
This is the code you have to change:**
[4 prompt add ajax.md](https://github.com/RoboDurden/Schizobene-3d-webgame/blob/main/deepseek%20prompts/4%20prompt%20add%20ajax.md)


and then i had to fix bugs and add features for another few days !
The Deepseek programming style of course is only the average coder - so no object oriented programming :-(
I of course would have written a class CWall which contains an array of CObject and gap and final target position would be stored in CWall.
Deepseek only made one big array walls which contains all the 73 objects and one loop over all to check for collision and target :-(
That is why the target detection in the final wall did not work and i had to rewrite the code several times because of no nice object oriented class structure :-(

the future of ai coding will be awesome..
- The answer should not only contain the code but a refined input prompt which the ai would have preferred.
- the output should list all the features implemented and possible problems - which Deepseek already does.
- Then people with no programming skills at all could interactively add features and fix bugs.
- And yeah, Deepseek should be able to play the game itself and analyze the video stream to see if its code works as it thinks it should :-)

## the future of ai coding will be awesome..
